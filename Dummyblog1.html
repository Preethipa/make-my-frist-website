        <p>Books are friends who never leave your side. I find this saying to be very true as books have always been there for me. 
            I enjoy reading books. They have the power to help us travel through worlds without moving from our places. 
            In addition, books also enhance our imagination. Growing up, my parents and teachers always encouraged me to read. They taught me the importance of reading. Subsequently, I have read several books. However, one boom that will always be my favourite is Harry Potter. It is one of the most intriguing reads of my life. 
            I have read all the books of this series, yet I read them again as I never get bored of it.
        </p>
    
        <div class="head-blogs">Harry Potter Series</div>
    
        <p>Harry Potter was a series of books authored by one of the most eminent writers of our generation, J.K. Rowling. 
            These books showcase the wizarding world and its workings. J.K. Rowling has been so successful at weaving a picture of this world, that it feels real. Although the series contains seven books,
            I have a particular favourite. My favourite book from the series is The Goblet of fire.<br>
                
             When I started reading the book, it caught my attention instantly. Even though I had read all the previous parts, none of the books caught my attention as this one did. It gave a larger perspective into the wizarding world. One of the things which excite me the most about this book is the introduction of the other wizard schools. 
            The concept of the Tri-wizard tournament is one of the most brilliant pieces I have come across in the Harry Potter series.
        </p>
    
            <div class="head-blogs">What Harry Potter Series Taught Me?</div>
    
        <p>Even though the books are about the world of wizards and magic, the Harry Potter series contains a lot of lessons for young people to learn. 
            Firstly, it teaches us the importance of friendship. I have read many books but never come across a friendship like that of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. 
            These three musketeers stuck together throughout the books and never gave up. It taught me the value of a good friend.
            <br>
    
             Further, the series of Harry Potter taught me that no one is perfect. Everyone has good and evil inside them. 
             We are the ones who choose what we wish to be. This helped me in making better choices and becoming a better human being.
             We see how the most flawed characters like Snape had goodness inside them. Similarly, how the nicest ones like Dumbledore had some bad traits. 
            This changed my perspective towards people and made me more considerate.
