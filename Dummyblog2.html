        <p>Newspapers are one of the most important documents. They can be said to be the powerhouse of information.
             Moreover, they offer us other benefits as well which helps us in our lives. You become better informed through newspaper reading and it also broadens your perspective.
            However, newspaper reading is becoming a dying habit. As the world is moving towards digitalization, no one really reads the newspaper. 
            At least not the present generation. The readership is maintained mostly because of the older generations only.
        </p>
    
        <div class="head-blogs">Benefits of Newspaper Reading</div>
    
        <p>Newspaper reading is one of the most beneficial habits. It helps us get acquainted with the current affairs of the world.
             We get to know about the latest happenings through a reliable source. 
             Similarly, we also get an insight into the different domains including politics, cinema, business, sports and many more.
            Furthermore, newspaper reading also results in opening doors to new employment opportunities. 
            Reliable companies post their ads in the newspaper for business and employment opportunities so we see how it is a good place to seek jobs.
            <br>

            Most importantly, it also improves the vocabulary and grammar of a person. You can learn new words and rectify your grammar through newspaper reading.
            In addition, a person who reads a newspaper can speak fluently on various topics. They can socialize better as they are well aware of the most common topics. 
            Similarly, it also saves us from getting bored. You won't need any company if you have a newspaper in hand.

            <div class="head-blogs">The Dying Habit</div>
    
        <p>Unfortunately, despite having so many benefits, newspaper reading is becoming a dying habit. 
            As people are getting instant updates on their mobile phones and computer systems, they barely read the newspaper.
             Moreover, electronic gadgets are more convenient for them so they don't bother to pick up the newspaper.
             People do not wait for newspapers anymore, as they feel it only states what they have already been informed about. 
             In addition, they do not wait for the next day to read the newspaper about current affairs, as they get it instantly thanks to the internet.
            <br>
            Most importantly, people are themselves running out of the habit of reading itself. 
            Everything has become so visual now that no one bothers to read newspapers, books, novels or more. The internet has made it worse as now there is a video for everything. 
            People won't mind watching a five-minute video, but will however not prefer to read a five-minute-long article.
            It just shows how we're becoming so inactive and lazy.Therefore, we must not let this become a dying habit as newspapers are very reliable sources of news.
